# HDBOOKMARKS

A one stop shop for all the usfull links and other information that an agent on the service desk might need.

## Motivation

When I first joined the service desk there was a bookmarks page that was created by someone else that had left the service desk. This what the service desk bookmarks page look like before.

Not too bad but having to scroll to find a link isn't my style. Also when I first started I needed to click on all the link to see where they would take me. So I came up with the following check list

- Search for links rather than scrolling to find them
- Show picture of links to know where it will take you
- Add some other feature from service now

I ended up creating this

- Search for a link you might be looking for
- Quick copy feature for coping common things that are used
- Place to show where all the URMC KBs are and links to them
